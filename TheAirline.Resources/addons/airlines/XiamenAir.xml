Established on July 25, 1984 and based in Xiamen,Fujian Province it operates scheduled passenger flights out of Xiamen Gaoqi International Airport and, to a lesser extent, Fuzhou Changle International Airport and Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport. The airline is owned by China Southern Airlines (51%), Xiamen Construction and 
    Development Group (34%), and Jizhong Energy Group (15%). XiamenAir is the only major Chinese carrier which operates an all Boeing fleet, which consists of mostly 737's. XiamenAir was honored with the title of 'The Best Airline In Mainland China' for 6 consecutive quarters in the 'Airlines Service Survey' 
    made by CARNOC.com. The survey consists of comprehensive questionnaires answered by the passengers and analyzed by experts. 
    By early 2014, Xiamen Airlines has 6 branches in Fuzhou, Nanchang, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Changsha, and Beijing. The airline operates 218 domestic routes along with 26 international routes (Including routes to Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan). It flies over 3600 flights per week. XiamenAir ranks #4 among all Chinese carriers by domestic capacity (only less than the 'Big Three' national carriers), and contributes 7.2% of the domestic capacity in China.
The airline is regarded as one of the most profitable airlines in the world, having made a profit every year since 1988." />
