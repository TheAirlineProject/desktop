It was founded in 1950 in Springfield,MO and flew from there to St. Louis with Beech 17 Staggerwings and then Cessna AT-17 Bobcat's. They were certified to begin new routes in 1950 and were officially founded then. They flew DC-3s from St. Louis to Chicago,Tulsa in Oklahoma and to Memphis in Tennessee. In 1955 they had 13 DC-3s and 35 destinations. In 1960 they got some Fairchild F-27's and in 1964 some Martin 4-0-4's. At it's end in 1986 they served 57 mainline cities and 21 Midwestern cities. They had 46 DC-9's of a few variations and four MD-82s. They were bought by TWA for $242 million in 1986 and their fleet was gradually repainted into TWA colors over the next few years. A second Ozark Air Lines began in 2000 after William E. Stricker of Coumbia,MO bought the name rights, it also flew out of Columbia and Chicago-Midway using Fairchild Dornier 328JET's, but it only lasted a year and was bought by Great Plains Airlines.
