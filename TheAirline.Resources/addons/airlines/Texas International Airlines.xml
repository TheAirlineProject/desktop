    <narrative narrative=" Texas International was founded in 1944 as Aviation Enterprises. Then from 1947-1969 as Trans-Texas Airways. They had a hub at Houston Hobby and then moved that to Houston's newer George Bush Airport as it's called today after it opened in 1969. It also had a hub in Dallas. In 1949 they served 26 destinations all in Texas with DC-3's nicknamed Starliners. Over their life they served 46 seperate Texas airports, 11 in Arkansas, 9 in Louisiana, 7 in New Mexico, 12 in Mexico, and 24 throughout other U.S states from the west coast to the east coast. Thier main fleet was composed of DC-9s from the late 60s onwards. They also used Convair 600's and 240's beforehand. In 1972 Jet Capital Corporation bought them and turned them around from losing $3 million a year to earning $6 million, spearheaded by JCC's head man Frank Lorenzo. In 1980 he and his company established Texas Air Corporation for the airline, which then bought Continantal Airlines in 1982, and then merged Continental with Texas International in the same year. Continental inherited TI's large Houston hub. In 2010 Continental merged with United and stopped operating under it's name in 2012.  " /></profile>
