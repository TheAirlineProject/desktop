    <narrative narrative=" Braniff was the attempt at continuing the strong brand name Braniff International had established in the U.S, many called them Braniff II. Founded a year after the end of the original company this one was founded using some of the assets from the original and was funded by Hyatt Hotels and Hyatt's Jay Pritzker was their first CEO who managed to bring the company out of bankruptcy and bring it back. It's hub was Dallas-Ft. Worth and also had others at Orlando,FL and Kansas City,MO. It's first flight was a special celebration where the son's of the original Braniff's founders, who share the name of the company, attended and flew on it from Oklahoma City, one of the two original cities the first Braniff served, to Dallas. In 1984 it served 17 airports with the 727. Thier original business model of focusing on business travelers didn't work and they losy money so they converted to 1 class low fares, and all seats had leather. In 1989 it served 40 airports with the Bamaha's being the only non-U.S destination, and by this time hey had chosen Kansas City to be their main hub. In 1988 they aquired Florida Express Airlines and moved the headquarters from Dallas to Orlando.  In 1988 they ordered new Fokker 100's and took over 50 Airbus A320 orders from Pan Am. This helped lead them towards the bankruptcy of 1989. They liquidated all assets in three seperate auctions. America West got their new A320's. Their would be one more failed attempt at using the Braniff name from 1991-1992. They also used 737-200's, and BAC 111's.   " /></profile>
