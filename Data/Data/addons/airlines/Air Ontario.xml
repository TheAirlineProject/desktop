  <narrative narrative="Air Ontario was based at London,Ontario,Canada. It was a subsidiary of Air Canada and ended when it merged with several other airlines to form the airline Jazz in 2002. They also had a focus city or hub at Toronto Island Airport, also known as Billy Bishop Airport. At the end they had 6 or 7 Dash 8-300's and 24 or so Dash 8-100's. They were the newer version of an airline that lasted from 1958-1983 called Great Lakes Airlines, no relation to the U.S airline of the same name. Air Ontario was the same corporation with a new owner and name. They also did flights to the U.S."/>
