It serves mostly Quebec and Ontario and the north east US. It has a FBO at its base and at Montreal-Trudeau also. It was founded in 1954 after Emilien Pronovost bought La Sarre Air Service. The comapny grew over the years and was passed to his 2 daughters and 2 sons. An airline called Air Fecteau was bought and merged also. As its name might suggest it has only prop planes, at May 2012 it had ten Beechcraft King Air's, a Beechcraft 1900C and a Grumman Gulfstream I. It has also had Fairchild Metroliners before too." />
