However over its life it served 26 domestic destinations, three in the US, two in Venezuela,four in Columbia,three in Bolivia,two in Brazil and one in Paraguay which it had terminated somewhere along the line. From 1993 to the end Aeromexico owned about 70% of it and it was a subsidiary. It spent $54 million dollars for those shares. Delta Air Lines also had a 35% stake starting in 1998. Planes it had included three Fokker F28's at the start which it had got from SATCO, an earlier airline ran by the army. A 727 joined the fleet shortly after and they ordered two Fokker F27's. 1974 saw the addition of two DC-8's and the launch of international routes. At the end it had three 757's and some 727's.
