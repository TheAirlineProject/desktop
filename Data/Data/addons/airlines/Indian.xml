They called Delhi and Mumbai their main homes, with secondary hubs at Chennai and Kolkata. They had a subsidiary founded in 1996 called Alliance Air that was rebranded as Air India Regional after the merger. It was founded in 1953 and flew to 63 destinations, all but 8 of them in India, and all were in Asia. That doesn't count its subsidiaries. At the time of the merger in 2011 it had 28 A320's,20 A321's, and 24 A319's, which would all be repainted into Air India livery. It was formed in 1953 with the merger of 8 domestic airlines in an effort to nationalise the Indian airline industry like in Britain. "></narrative>
