It serves 57 destinations around the world. If it wants they can also use the cargo hold of any Lufthansa Group plane if need be, which would include 300 passengers planes of such airlines as Austrian,Brussels, and SunExpress airlines. German Cargo was their previous incarnation that was also owned and operated by Lufthansa, and in fact Lufthansa Cargo was used as a brand by them even before the official founding of the seperate airline. German Cargo was around from 1977-1993, right before Lufthansa Cargo's founding, and some of the old cargo carriers assets were transferred to the new Lufthansa Cargo including some planes." />
