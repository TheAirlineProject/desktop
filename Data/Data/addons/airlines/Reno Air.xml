    <narrative narrative=" Reno Air was based at it's namesake city of Reno,Nevada. It also had a hub at San Jose,CA. It was founded in June 1990 by Frontier Airlines alumnus Joseph Lorenzo and Midway Airlines executive Jeff Erickson. It's first flight on July 1,1992 was from Reno to Seattle,WA. It started a hub at San Jose in 1993 leasing a gate from American Airlines, a move by AA to outsource the operation to a lower-cost operator to help compete with Southwest Airlines. Reno Air also adopted AA's AAdvantage frequnt fliers program. Expanding from the west coast they started a seperate route system that was unconnected to the routes on the west in Gulfport,Mississippi. They flew to the Tampa area,Orlando and Atlanta from here. In 1996 they began focusing more on Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Seattle, offering 25 nonstop flights at Las Vegas and opening a reservations center there. In 1999 American puchased them, and by 2001 nothing of the original Reno existed anymore having got rid of it's planes and downgrading Reno from a hub to cut costs following the blow to the airline industry in late 2001. At it's end it served 16 destinations all in the U.S. All 27 of it's planes were MD-80 types and MD-90's." /></profile>
