             <narrative
      narrative="Air Do previously known as Hokkaido International Airlines was founded in 1996 by Teruo Hamada, a poultry farmer in Hokkaidō, shortly after the Japanese government approved a domestic airline deregulation policy that would allow carriers to freely set fares on domestic routes. Hamada gathered investments from 29 other individuals who were interested in establishing a low-cost airline to compete with Japan's major domestic carriers (All Nippon Airways, Japan Airlines, and Japan Air System) on flights between Hokkaido cities and Tokyo." />
