  <narrative narrative="Deutsche Lufthansa was a rival East German airline of Lufthansa of West Germany. It was based at Berlin Schonefeld and lasted from 1955-1963 when Interflug 
  took over as the main East German airline. It failed because Lufthansa of West Germany sued it for using their brand name which they had rights to, and as a result it was also
  barred from membership in ICAO and IATA. They flew Il-14s and Il-18s. They served 14 destinations and 5 domestic ones. All destinations were in Soviet countries of Europe or close allies."/>
