  <narrative narrative="Myanmar Airways International is based at Yangon,Myanmar (Burma) and was once part of Myanmar Airways, now called Myanmar National Airlines starting in December 2014. International was spun off from Myanma in 1993 to handle the international flights while Myanma would do the domestic ones. The original entity was founded in 1946 as the Union of Burma Airways. The International branch was a joint venture between Myanma and Highsonic Enterprises of Singapore and support from Royal Bruineu Airlines was also part of it.  Much of the management team were ex Singapore Airlines staff and ran by UK Civil Aviation Authority standards. It had two 737-400's from around the beginning to as late as August 2001. Eventually it broke off from Myanma and in January 2001 a new company called Region Air Myanmar got 49% of it, an 11% stake was bought by a local business man and his company. In 2009 it got two A320-200's and in 2013 it got 3 A319's which it still has 2 of. It also has one ATR 72-500 which they have had since 2007. An MD-82 was a common plane in its fleet from 2003 to around 2010. Other planes it has leased for short times include a 757-200,737-300,737-800,A321,and Fokker 100.
