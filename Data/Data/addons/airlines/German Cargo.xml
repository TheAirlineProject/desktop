It was also a part of Lufthansa and made it's base at Frankfurt. It started off as a cargo charter business but soon started scheduled service to mainly East Africa and the Middle East. Transporting live animals became part of their business such as horses which they had DC-8's refurbished to do. In 1993 Lufthansa reshaped their cargo division and split German Cargo in two making Lufthansa Cargo and Lufthansa Cargo Charter, the latter being for cargo charters and leasing.  They also operated 707's,737-200's,and 747-200F's, which the 747's would be transferred to Lufthansa Cargo." />
