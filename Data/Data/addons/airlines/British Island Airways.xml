    <narrative narrative="British Island Airways was around from 1970-1980 in its own right, when it merged with Air Anglia an Air Wales and Air Westward to form AirUK. It was spun off again though in 1982 as a charter airline subsidiary. That lasted until 1991.
    It made its home at London Gatwick. They operated domestic and some international routes and had planes like Handley Page Darts,BAC 111s,DC-3s,EMB 110s, and MD-83s." />
