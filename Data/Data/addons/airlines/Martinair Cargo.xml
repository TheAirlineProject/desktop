 <narrative narrative="Martinair as a passenger airline ceased in 2011 but its cargo operation still lives on. Martinair was founded in 1958 and only a few years later KLM bought most of it and it became a subsidiary to KLM. They share cargo duties with KLM Cargo both being part of KLM-Air France. Martinair Cargo is mostly responsible for the America's and UK. As of December 2013 it is loaning four 747-400ERF's from KLM Cargo, and has six MD-11F's of its own. "/>
