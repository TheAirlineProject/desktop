  <narrative narrative="New England Airlines is based at Westerly and Block Island both in the state of Rhode Island. Its only scheduled route is in fact Westerly-Block Island. On most summer days it operates the route from 7:30AM to 6:30PM with a flight half past every hour from WST to BID and on the hour from BID to WST. Thusday goes to 7:30PM and Friday 8:30PM. Every other season is every other hour and from 8 to 6. It was founded in 1970 and has the same owners that founded it. As of 2014 it had three Britten Norman Islanders, three Piper Cherokee Sixes and a Piper Cherokee. They will do charters to Block Island from anywhere in the lower 48 states, but mostly in the area of their namesake of New England and New York."/>
