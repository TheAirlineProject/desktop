It also leased 6 737-770's much of the time it was Cimber Sterling. 4 of the CRJ200s and an ATR 72 would go on to be the starting fleet of Cimber A/S. Other planes in its past are the Aeropostiale N 262,Gulfstream I and Fokker VFW 614. The 614 was a jet and Cimber had 2,and only 16 of the type were ever made.
