They are based at Valencia with other hubs at Barcelona and Madrid. It was founded in 1994 and in 1997 became a franchise for Iberia but are not owned by Iberia at all. A group called Nefinsa owns 74.8% of it, with a group called Caja Duero owning 22.2% and the other 3% is owned by the managers of the airline. It has absorbed the Iberia subsidiary Binter Mediterraneo and its operations and got the routes that belonged to Aviaco after Iberia merged with that airline.
